# GridGame

A while ago I published a [medium article](https://medium.com/@bzogrammer/programming-in-hyperspace-pt-2-7f62dd568373) where I discussed weird variations on Bloom Filters.

Among them was a data structure I proposed called a Grid Filter. The idea seemed to work well on paper, so this is an attempt to actually build something non-trivial with it to show off how useful it actually is.
